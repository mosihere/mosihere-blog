### This is a Django-Weblog.

### ease of use:
+ clone the repository
+ create a virtual-environment like this --> `virtualenv .venv`
+ then active it --> `source .venv/bin/activate`
  - to deactivate it just use `deactivate`
+ install the requirements.txt
  - ` python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
+ run the project
  - python manage.py runserver
  
Hope you'll enjoy it!
